# How Christianity Became Christian

## Differentiation from Judaism

Everything we know about Jesus contains many layers of retrospective editing. 

The virginity of Mary, for example, has contradictions. Some texts state she is a virgin, some not.  Followers of Jesus, decades after his death tried to make sense of a person who never wrote anything down himself and whose movements created many different records. 

Early followers had many contradictions — none of them agreed with each other. 

Over time, people gained enough power to declare versions of Christianity as orthodox. Christians endeavored for purity and orthodoxy. 

Jesus of Nazareth was prophesized to bring massive change to the Jewish, establishing a new kingdom of Israel. However, he was executed, leading to skepticism as to whether he was really the messiah. 

Since then, there are many people who have claimed to be the messiah. One of them were Sabbatai Zevi, and many people followed him and waited for him to restore Jerusalem. Zevi went to Sultan, who was not amused, and gave him the option to convert to Islam or die, and he chose to convert to Islam. 

Paul — went around the Mediterranean, declaring that the original law of the Jews were invalid and that the Christian Bible was the new idea that everyone should follow. According to Paul, because God's true religion was of the spirit rather than the flesh, it was a religion for everyone. Anyone at all could become a Jesus follower.

The Jewish Christians were pretty much destroyed after the sack of Jerusalem — but Paul's Christians, the Gentile Christians, were all around the Mediterranean. The split from there on would be between the Gentile Christians and the Jewish.

Two sides of the continum — Jews who rejected outright Jesus, and Christians who said that the Hebrew Bible should be scrapped. 

There were, of course, many interpretations in between. There were many disagreements of the identity of Jesus. The Christian Gospel of John begins with an opening regarding God. 

Over the course of the second century a larger and larger majority of followers of Jesus were not Israelites at all. This diversity brought a total lack of interest with any historical relationship with the Israelites. This leads to a large amount of Christians not being aware at all of the Hebrew bible, and of course, not caring at all.  

When it came to answering questions regarding Jesus, many Christians went to Greek and Roman scripture. These new writings became known as the New Testament. The split between Judaism and Christianity was very slow. In fact, at one point, there was a group of people who saw no contradiction between being both Jew and Christian at the same time.

## The Maelstrom of Christianity

There were many many versions of Christianity following the rise of the New Testament. Christians today acknowledge the four Gospels and the all of the Apostles, and the book of revelation.  

The Gospel of Mary was not accepted because Peter and the others were malding that Jesus would go to a woman before them.

In the Gospel of Thomas, when asked how to pray, Jesus instead gives guidelines on how to live with virtue. 

### Gnosticism

Many of the Gnostics considered themselves followers of Jesus. The core of Gnosticism was that the problem for humans was not sin but ignorance — there is a lack of knowledge and the reason for being so is that matter is evil and humans are made of matter. The world was created not by god but by a lower god. 

Jesus then brought true knowledge to earth, and those who understand that knowledge can transcend matter and live a life of spirit. 

### Canon of Scripture

Limited genuine revelation to only what Church leaders said it was. Canonization was about creating a rule by which all ideas can be measured.

Origninally, Canon was created in response to the need to reject Jewish scripture that Marcius did not think belonged. Irenaeus declared that there were only four valid Gospels. Later on, there was more orthodoxy — there was a declaration of canon closed.

Bishops declare that everyting anyone needs is already there, and that anything new is an affront to the original revelation. 

### Manichaeism

There was a sect of Gnostics that claimed that Jesus had not had a body and was just pure spirit. From that sect there was a boy named Mani. He learned about Buddhism and Hinduism and founded Manichaeism. Mani claimed that he was a fulfillment of Zoroaster, Khrishna, and Buddha, a radical dualism created by the flesh and the spirit. He states that Jesus was important because it was the perfect model for escape from body to spirit. 

Manichaeism spread very quickly.

Large debate about the nature of Jesus. After a few week, it was determined that the Father, Son, Holy
