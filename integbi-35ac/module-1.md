  other than as notes for open-book quizzes. The class is more interesting and

# Module 1

## The History of Life on Earth

The earliest evidence of life on earth is dated for around 3.5 billion years ago. As we learned in our high school science classes, we \(in terms of humans\) originate from the first eukaryotic cell. 

**The two major cell types are eukaryotes and prokaryotes.**

There are three domains of life, eukaryota, bacteria, and archaea.

## Kingdom Animalia

The vast majority of animals are both motile \(they move around\) and they are heterotrophic \(meaning that they need to eat.\) The majority \(around 90 percent\) are invertebrates, meaning that they do not have an internal skeleton. Furthermore, 90 percent of all vertebrates are mammals, and most are fish.
