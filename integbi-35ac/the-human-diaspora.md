# The Human Diaspora

There are 21 different ancestry groups, as described by the _Baker et. al_ paper. No one person is just one ancestry group — most humans have evidence of at least six ancestry groups in their genomes.

Y DNA and mtDNA data shows that at one point, the human population experienced a bottleneck. It restricted genetic variation, sometime around 50k years ago. 

One theory postulates that 74k years ago, a giant volcano erupted and led to years of volcanic ash, perhaps causing a decline in human populations. 

Regardless of the volcanic eruption, there was nevertheless a lot of global termperature oscillations, the volcanic eruption happened as we were heading to an ice age. 

There are two populations that account for a lot of the genetic cariation in euro\[eans and asians today, the Basal Eurasioans/Ancient North Eurasians. 

What we know about the group

* This group had no Neanderthal admixture. There were no genetic affinities. 
* There was a major and distinctive population that seems to have actually had many subpopulatiions. It was a stable and major population center for himans. 
* We don't know who these people were, there isn't really an old enough skeletons to represent someone from that time.
* We know they existed because there are traces of them in the genome, but we don't have any of their actual DNA.

We think that they might be related to a people than the Natufians, a people who were around much later than the Basal Eurasians. 

"Ghost population of Ancient North Eurasian" population, we only know they existed because of evidence in modern genomes. 

### Gravettians

Made Venus vigurines, did cave art, and were very prolific hunters. They even had oil lmaps that were made out of stone. As the last ice age got into swing, they Gravettians had to move out of Europe. 

### Magdalaneans

Around 24k years ago, there was a shift in temperature, around 5 deg C avg drop. There was less precipitation, more desert, less tropical rainforest. Grobal productivity is estimated to been hjalf what is postglacial;ly. Sea level dropped about 120 meters. Around 19k, 14k years ago, the ice started to recede. 

These people, the magadalaneans, had taken resgure on the ibearian population dring the last ice age. AS the ice sheets receded, this populaiton expended north and east. They were associated with teh extinction of some species of mammothy. 

They had bone and ivory tools, and did art. 

We trhink that there was a warming event called the bolling allerod warming event. With this dramatic climatological event, human culture
