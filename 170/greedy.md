# Greedy

Greedy algorithms build a solution iteratively using a sequence of local choices â€” it's another method of algorithm solving.

## Huffman Encoding

Suppose you have an alphabet $$\Sigma$$, and a text that use characters that come from $$\Sigma$$. The frequency of any given character is the number of times it ocurrs. We want to find an unambiguous way for encoding the string.

### Prefix Free Encoding

In order to encode our string in such a way that it is not ambiguous, we can just encode it such that no character's encoding is a prefix of any other character's encoding.
