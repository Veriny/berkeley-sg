# Lists and Sets

## Sets

Sets are collections of items with no particular order. Duplicates are not allowed.

```java
Set<String> artifacts = new HashSet<>();
S.add("Gladiator's Finale");
S.add("Heart of Depths");
S.add("Blizzard Strayer");
```

Here are some useful set methods.

| Method | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| `boolean add(Type thing)` | If the item is not already in the set, add it to the set. |
|  |  |

{% hint style="success" %}
TODO: Fill in information about lists.
{% endhint %}
