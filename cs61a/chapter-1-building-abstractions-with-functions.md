# Chapter 1: Building Abstractions with Functions

**Note: This is meant to be a personal guide and as such there are things in the earlier chapters that I did not think were worth adding as they did not personally benefit my study. As such, the first few study guides should be approached as incomplete.**

### 1.2 — Elements of Programming 

The first concept to grasp in programming is expressions, the most primitive of which is simply a number.

```bash
>>> 69
69
```

Numbers of course, can be combined with _operators,_ such as +, -, or %. 

```bash
>>> 400 + 20
420
```

This should be fairly obvious, so I suppose the most important thing to note here is vocabulary. The textbook calls this _infix_ notation, where _operators_ appear between _operands_ \(numbers\).
