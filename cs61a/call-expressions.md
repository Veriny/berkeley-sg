# Call Expressions

An example of a call expression is the following.

```python
operator(operand, operand)
```

There is a specific evaluation procedure for call expressions.

* Evaluate the operator, and then the operand expressions.
* Apply the operator to the evaluated operand expressions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you can **nest** call expressions. In other words, operands can be other operator with its own operands.
{% endhint %}

Things like numbers, names, etc are just called primitive expressions.
