# Sets + Mathematical Notation

| Term | Symbol | Meaning | TEX |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Subset | $$\subseteq$$  | If every element of $$A$$ is in $$B,$$ we say that $$A \subseteq B.$$  | `\subseteq` |
| Proper Subset | $$\subset$$  | If every element of $$A$$ is in $$B,$$ but the two sets are guaranteed to not be equal, we say that $$A \subset B.$$  | `\subset` |
| Intersection | $$\cap$$  | Used to denote the set of elements that are shared between two sets. $$A\ \cap\ B$$ denotes the set containing elements shared between $$A$$ and $$B.$$ | `\cap` |
| Union | $$\cup$$  | Used to denote the set that contains all elements of one or many sets, whether they are shared or not. $$A\ \cup\ B$$denotes the set containing elements contained in $$A$$ and $$B.$$ | `\cup` |
| Complement | $$^\complement$$  | Used to denote items that are in one set but not the other. $$A^\complement B$$ is the set of elements that are contained in $$A$$but not in $$B.$$ | `\complement` |
| Cross Product | $$\times$$  | Used to denote the set of pairs those first component is in $$A$$and whose second is in$$B.$$ | `\times` |
| In | $$\in$$  | Used to show an item is in a set. | `\in` |
| Not In | $$\notin$$  | Used to show an item is not in a set. | `\notin` |
| Conjunction | $$\wedge$$  | $$P\ \wedge \ Q$$ is true if both $$P$$and$$Q$$are true. | `\land` |
| Disjunction | $$\lor$$  | If either $$P$$and$$Q$$are true, then $$P\ \lor \ Q$$is true. | `\lor` |
| Set | $$\{\}$$  | Used to denote a set. | `\{\}` |
| Implies | $$\implies$$  | $$P \implies  Q$$ states that $$P$$ being true means $$Q$$is true. Doesn't give any info about what happens when $$P$$is false. |  `\implies` |
| Iff | $$\iff$$  | If and only if. | `\iff` |
| For all | $$\forall$$  | Used to refer to all of the elements within a specific set. | `\forall` |
| There exists | $$\exists$$  | Used to declare the existance of one or more of something. | `\exists` |
| Negation | $$\neg$$  | $$\neg P$$ is true when $$P$$is false. | `\neg` |
