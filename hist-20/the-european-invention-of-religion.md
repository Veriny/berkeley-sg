# The European Invention of Religion

The concept of religion was invented because it was convenient to the Christians who did. The issue was brought by the the need for comparative analysis of various religions.

This is based on christian and white supremacist concepts.

Religious is inherently comparative â€” there are many religions out there.  Among Christians, religion was Christianity and Christianity was religion in the early years. Christians believed that religion had been restablished twice. Everything else was a failture of Christianity. Therefore, everything is Christiaznity. 

IN fact, according to some Christians, the Pagan gods et. al were a lot of devils who existed to draw people away from god. 

Before, religion was normative rather than plural. 

## Americas

When the Europeans arrived in the Americas, they found that the Aztecs and Incas had societies similar to Europeans. They had society, they had trade, they had commerce, and they had some ritualistic worship fo the gods. However,. ther was nto a way to compare the more bloody religiouin of the Americas to Christianity, however tehre were many simi8larities between the Incas and Aztecs' religion and christianity. There had to be point of contact to extablish political ril;es, labpor,, religious conversion. Curopeans had to learn to manage a multi cultural empire. 

Michel de Montaigne blew up the notion of savergey from a relativist framework. He who did not grow up witth a practice wil think it's a barbaric act,. 

COmiug into contact with differen people will cause poeple top think in terms oif comparatic9is.
