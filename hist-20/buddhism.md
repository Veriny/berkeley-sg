# Buddhism

_Introduction to the History of Indian Buddhism —_ written by a french writer and claimed that all east Asian religions stemmed from it. 

In one sense, the different religions practiced in China, Tibet, etc, are as much as close as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are, in the sense that they are kind of the same religion but kind of not. 

Defining religious boundaries are particularly difficult with Buddhism. Let us explore the diversity of the Buddhist world — in other words, the different paths to enlightenment.

There is reverence of the three jewels — Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

## Original Epic

There was a clan called the Gautama, and the leader of the clan and the entire state was a man named Suudhodana. 

According to legend, Suddhodana's wife Maya had a dream where she was pierced in the side by a white elephant and this caused her pregnancy — a child conceived without sexual intercourse. When the child was born, he announced that this would be a final birth, meaning that he has broken the cycle of death and rebirth.

The boy would grow up, find a wife, and have a son.

Looking at the names of the characters and their meanings, we can pretty much easily conclude that these names were pretty clearly made up.

It is said that Buddha, after being secluded, went out on a journey, and saw a poor man, a sick man, and a dead man. Seeing this, Buddha decides to become a sage, and wanting to search for enlightenment. For six years, he experimented with extreme deprivations, such as fasting. 

One day, he was convinced to eat some food. Although his fellow sages were disgusted, he began realizing that he finally found the middle way. Not extreme deprivation, but not luxury. Renunciation is about not needing things and not about not having things. 

He sits under a Bodhi tree, and states that he will stay there until he reaches enlightenment. The demon Mara assaults him, tempting him with doubts in his mind. He attains enlightenment and becomes the Buddha.

Following his enlightenment, he taught for 45 years and was not reborn, but passed into nirvana.

For Hindus, Dharma means virtue, right action, etc. For Buddhists, it means following the Buddha.

Four noble truths:

* Suffering is inevitable
* There is a cause for suffering — this cause is desire
* Suffering will end — end desires, end suffering
* The end to suffering is contained in the eight fold path.

The Noble Eightfold Path — recognize the path, follow the path, achieve nirvana. The final stages of meditation are infinite nothingness, to the lack of perception. When you get past those stages and reached the end of feeling, you have achieved enlightenment. 

For the early buddhist, this was it. The goal was to dissipate and become one with everything else in the universe. This is called nirvana. 

## The Sangha

While the Buddha had offered Dharma to everyone, his path imposed a strict discipline on the people who followed him. In order to be a Buddhist, you must follow the path of Buddha.

The monks collectively actually became very wealthy as many people supported them by giving them money and land. As such, these communities became fabulously wealthy. 

Of course, there is corruption where there is wealth. Laws written for the monks which had punishment such as expulsion and probation tell us this.

### Women

According to the tradition, the Buddha did not want women as monks, but his Aunt marched with 500 other women and demanded the rights to become monks successfully. According to the legend, women were a mistake.

Women were considered theoretically capable of progressing through the eightfold path and become enlightened. However, the state of the Buddha was without sex, and in the minds were men, women were too closely intertwined with sex for them to really imagine them transcending their sex.

Men also saw that it was harder for women to abandon desire. Women were therefore admitted but they had extra rules that they had to abide to. 

### Different Sects

Following quickly after the Buddha's death, the Sangha split into many sects over disagreements over interpretations of the texts, or entirely new ones being added altogether. 

Emperor Ashoka, ruler of a lot of land, converted to Buddhism, and patronized the Sangha. However, he attempted to regulate the Sangha, executing and /or exiling what he saw as heretic monks. He also established a Dharma police. This was a unique and rare point in Buddhist history in which religion and politics intertwined.

With the death fo Ashoka, the empire began to split apart. When the last emperor of the line was assainated, there was a resurgance of Hinduism. Buddhism then fragmented into many different forms. 

### Manayana Buddhism

Meant to make Buddhism more accessible — for the larger people, not only for monks. We don't know how or when it emerged. 

ANYONE can reach enlightment, the path to Buddha, in a single lifetime. The path is a committment to helping all other sentient beings attain Nirvana.

Mahayana declares that the Sangha is selfish, as you are only saving yourself from suffering and leaving others to suffer. Mahayana wants to have universal enlightenment. Manayana Buddhists believe that the Buddha is still with us, helping the universe behind the scenes.
