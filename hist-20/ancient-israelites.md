# Ancient Israelites

The Hebrew Bible is what Christians call the "Old Testament" — a term which is offensive to many Jews. In Herbrew, it is referred to the _Tanakh_, made up of the _Torah, Navi'im,_ and _Ketuvim._

Modern Jews look back to the Tanakh. The religions of the Israelites and Jews are fundementally different. When we study the Ancient Israelites, we are not looking at Judaism. 

The Israelites experienced several diasporas — historically, this was the transition from the state religion they held \(a national cult\) to something more like a religion. 

## Origins

The Hebrew bible, in essence, is a summary of the origins. The narrative goes — a man named Abraham made a covenant with god, who told him that his descendants whill create a great nation. His sons had 12 children, who made 12 tribes. The tribes that went to egypt were enslaved and remained so for 400 years, until the exodus. Following a series of wars, in around 1220 BCE, the kingdon of Israel was created. 

Is any of this true? 

For the early period, we don't really have anything to go on but the Bible. There's no real way to corroborate it. The first non-biblical mention comes from a stone inscription from Israel, dated abour six centuries before the Bible puts the time of Abraham.  

The honest truth is, there is no way of knowing whether the early figures in the Hebrew bibles were real people. 

## Era of Corroboration

Following the split of the Israel kingdom, we start seeing evidence outside of the Hebrew Bible that start to corroborate it. The Northern kingdom of Israel existed until around the Hebrew bible says. Assyrian wars against the Israelites, including a siege of Jerusalem, lines up with what is said in the Bible. 

The Israelites who stayed behind, following the Babylonians' conquering, created two sects, one wanting to rebel and one wanting to make peace. 

This was the beginning of the Babylonian captivity, lasting 50 years until the Persian conquest. The Babylonians destroyed the temple of Solomon, but when the Persians came, they allowed the Israelites to return to Jerusalem and build another temple at the site of the old one.  

### Diaspora

As the Israelite people were conquered by everyone, Israelites everywhere had ritual expectations that became central to their identity. Diaspora made Judaism into a religion of ritual practice. This essentially helped them keep an ethic/religious identity.

### Monotheism

Monotheism, within the Israelites, was a refusal to worship other gods, not a claim that other gods to not exist. This was actually a really normal idea in the ancient near east — each peoples had their own patron gods. For example, when Jephthah and the Ammonites debate land rights, the claim was that their god gave them the land that they were promised them, and the Israelites were given the land that their god gave them.

Later on, the Israelites did come truly monotheistic, denying the existence of other gods. 

What the Herbrew bible itself does, was that it showed how much people cheated on other gods, and describes the punishments that they faced. 

Another example is Jeremiah lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem, who said that it had happened because Israelites were worshipping other gods, but the people responeded that the disaster had happened because they were forced to stop worshipping other gods. 

## The Kingdom of Judah

Following the fall of Israel, there were many debates in the Kingdom of Judah regarding the methods of worshiping God. 

Upon reading a newly discovered Book of the Law, king Josiah declared that only God should be worshipped and the icons of other gods and priests of other gods be destroyed. He also ordered that all proper worship of God should be concentrated an Jerusalem, performed only by the priests of that temple. 

\(Of course, most historians believe that the Book of the Law was created by the high priest himself. Therefore, it is a concentration of power — a book of politics.\)

As such, from the time of King Josiah onwards, sacrifice was centralized at the one holy site at Jerusalem. It eliminated competition with other priests that worshipped other gods and priests who worshipped God at other places

### The Temple

The Temple was open every day for worship — huge gates that opened and closed at sunrise and sunset. There were private and public sacrifices, on behalf of individuals and the public alike.

It was an obligation for male Jewish people to go to the wall three times a year.

There were many large scale rituals — a group of hereditary priests, called the Cohens, who claimed to be descendants of Aaron.

This was a massive change. It was as if the Roman Catholic Church declared that any worship other than in Rome was idolatry. 

### The Prophets

These guys were attached to temples and their job was to create lines of communication between the divine and royalty. In terms of the Hebrew prohets, they began to make moral guidelines to live — constatnly complaining abouyt the idolatry of the people. 

They were the enemies of the priests. They believed that ethical positioning was mroe important than ritual, denouncing priestly ritual as impediments to religion.  Argues for moral purity — who cares if ritual is performed incorrectly, all god cares is that you are a person of virtue. 

### A Scriptural Religion

As time went on, Judaism went on and on to be more organized around texts. There were many texts that were revered, not just the Bible, which mainly was influenced by the priests. The priests had to include this text because it could not be ignored, even though it did not fit their faction's views. The Bible came into being as more and more new layers were added.

The remarkability of the Bible comes from the fact that it contains a record of all the contradicitons that it went thought

Although the texts were created to serve the Hebrew temple, in some ways it made the temple obsolete. Since sacrifice away from the temple was banned, Judaism without the temple \(e.g. Diaspora\) became the religion of the Bible.  

### Roman Era

When the Roman Empire conquered Jerusalem, the senate created a title called the King of the Jews, a puppet for the Roman empire the man appointed was Herod the Great, who built many fortresses and temples in the hopes that he would establish a dynasty. 

Later on, there was a rebellion, followed by another rebellion, followed by the Romans taking over again and destroying the temple that Herod built. 

Following, there were two branches of Judaism — one that addressed the diaspora by orgainizing religion around synagougues and religions text. The second branch was that Jesus was the messiah. The true israelites were not one nation but rather anyone could become an Israelite, just by believing in Jesus of Nazareth.
