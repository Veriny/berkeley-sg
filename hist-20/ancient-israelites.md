# Ancient Israelites

The Hebrew Bible is what Christians call the "Old Testament" — a term which is offensive to many Jews. In Herbrew, it is referred to the _Tanakh_, made up of the _Torah, Navi'im,_ and _Ketuvim._

Modern Jews look back to the Tanakh. The religions of the Israelites and Jews are fundementally different. When we study the Ancient Israelites, we are not looking at Judaism. 

The Israelites experienced several diasporas — historically, this was the transition from the state religion they held \(a national cult\) to something more like a religion. 

## Origins

The Hebrew bible, in essence, is a summary of the origins. The narrative goes — a man named Abraham made a covenant with god, who told him that his descendants whill create a great nation. His sons had 12 children, who made 12 tribes. The tribes that went to egypt were enslaved and remained so for 400 years, until the exodus. Following a series of wars, in around 1220 BCE, the kingdon of Israel was created. 

Is any of this true? 

For the early period, we don't really have anything to go on but the Bible. There's no real way to corroborate it. The first non-biblical mention comes from a stone inscription from Israel, dated abour six centuries before the Bible puts the time of Abraham.  

The honest truth is, there is no way of knowing whether the early figures in the Hebrew bibles were real people. 

## Era of Corroboration

Following the split of the Israel kingdom, we start seeing evidence outside of the Hebrew Bible that start to corroborate it. The Northern kingdom of Israel existed until around the Hebrew bible says. Assyrian wars against the Israelites, including a siege of Jerusalem, lines up with what is said in the Bible. 

The Israelites who stayed behind, following the Babylonians' conquering, created two sects, one wanting to rebel and one wanting to make peace. 

This was the beginning of the Babylonian captivity, lasting 50 years until the Persian conquest. The Babylonians destroyed the temple of Solomon, but when the Persians came, they allowed the Israelites to return to Jerusalem and build another temple at the site of the old one.  

### Diaspora

As the Israelite people were conquered by everyone, Israelites everywhere had ritual expectations that became central to their identity. Diaspora made Judaism into a religion of ritual practice. This essentially helped them keep an ethic/religious identity.

### Monotheism

Monotheism, within the Israelites, was a refusal to worship other gods, not a claim that other gods to not exist. This was actually a really normal idea in the ancient near east — each peoples had their own patron gods. For example, when Jephthah and the Ammonites debate land rights, the claim was that their god gave them the land that they were promised them, and the Israelites were given the land that their god gave them.

Later on, the Israelites did come truly monotheistic, denying the existence of other gods. 

What the Herbrew bible itself does, was that it showed how much people cheated on other gods, and describes the punishments that they faced. 

Another example is Jeremiah lamenting the destruction of Jerusalem, who said that it had happened because Israelites were worshipping other gods, but the people responeded that the disaster had happened because they were forced to stop worshipping other gods.
