# Hinduism

Hinduism does not have a specific holy book or prophet — but Hinduism does not particularly gatekeep — many Hindus have different beliefs. There are a lot of gods — the well know of which are Shiva and Vishnu.

Hinduism does not have a continuous existence — it is the result of the layering of many cultural practices.

Although many of the cultural layers of Hinduism contradicted each other, there was a sense of appropriation rather than rejection. 

## Origins

Religion in ancient India revolved around four religious texts know as the Vedas. The Rig Veda contained hymns, the Sama Veda contained liturgy, the Yajur Veda contained rituals, the Atharva Veda contained incantations. These were actually forbidden from being written down because having them memorized was what gave priests some of their power. 

When the texts were finally transcribed, there was a great conisistency between the texts because the memorization was so effective. 

We find a religion oraganized around a series of gods — not the Hindu ones we might expect. The most common god is Indra, the king of heaven, Agni, hte god of fire, and Souma, the god of the moon. 

The major gods of Hinduism are either completely missing, at this point, or are only found in limited ways. 

In this religions, there was a massive emphasis on priests and sacrifice. There were tons of rituals that only priests could do. These rituals pretty much 100 percent were done in order to influence the divine — quid pro quo. 

In this era, karma was the sense of causality in ritual.

There was a large amount of elitism — the benefits of sacrifice was only available to the elite.

The Hindu gods, are not, however, entirely missing. One of Vishnu's avatars is mentioned \(Vamana\) who tricks an evil king. He tricks the god Mahabali by telling him to give him all the land that he can walk over in three steps, — proceeding to turn into a giant and stepping over the entire universe. 

## The Indus Valley Civilization

The British had found some ruins of the Indus Valley Civilization and used the ruins to build railways. The bricks turned out to have belonged to some cities of the Indus Valley Civilizations. These were enormous cities, with nearly 50,000 inhabitants each. There was a remarkable degree of centralization. There were also inscription written — undecipherable, because there was no Rosetta Stone. 

There were many similarities between religions icons of this civilization and modern Hindu gods — the so called Pasupati Seal, and Shiva. 

Of course, it could just be a coincidence. 

## Upanishads/Vedanta

The end of the Vedas — some of the Upanishads were beginning to be written by the end of the Vedas era. 

We find in the Upanishads a large amount of new ideas, some which contradict the Vedas, or some who elaboate 

There are also some ideas called Brahman — the universal principle or divin, and Atman — the true self and soul.\

Whereas the Vedas was about doing rituals to get favors from the divine, the Upanishads was about understanding the connections between the Brahman and the Atman, — and realizing that they are one and the same, linked by their absolute permanence.

This was a rejection of the Vedic religion.

Reincarnation makes its appearance in the Upanishads. In this context, karma refers to the idea that your actions in the current life will affect your next life. Things brings in the idea Dharma — to do the right actions for who you are. For example, if you are reborn as a frog, you be the best frog you can be, and hopefully receive a higher birth. 

{% hint style="info" %}
With the previous model inequality is the natural state — and dharma declares that one should not rebel against the caste system. Because the caste system came before the idea of karma, some suspect that the idea of karma was invented in order to justify a stratified society. c

### Mahabharata/Ramayana

These were works of immense magnitude — orders of magnitude higher than the illiad and oddeysey combined. 

The text involves _warrior_ religion, not _priest_ religion. It doesn't stress that kings and rulers are second class to priests. The devotion to an avatar of identity was absent from Vedic religion.

Rama throwing his wife into a fire highlights that in general in these epics, women exist in these epics to bear sons and test their husbands' Dharma. 

## Path to Hinduism

Brahman priests began producing new texts — Dharmasutras, or guides to dharma. It raised the question regarding where Dharma comes from. Their answer was that dharma can't be understood fully from the Vedas — that there must be missing Vedas. However, because society was organized when the missing Vedas were organized, society should be modeled after those past societies. 

The Dharamashatras were the treatises of dharma, legal codes explaining the requirements of dharma for all different kinds of people. They synthesized the various parts of Hindu religion.
