# How Islam Became Muslim

The Kaaba was a place of worship for many gods and goddesses, over 360, perhaps one god per day of the year. In Arabia, there were also many Christians and Jews. 

Alcohol was forbidden as the work of the devil. The Quaran is eternal in the eyes of god, but Muslims themselves are engaged in the Quaran as a process. 

Mohammad's style of forced monotheism was bad for business, however, people from all over Arabia came there for worship. If suddenly, all those other Gods were banned, the trade would collapse. In the year 619, Mohammad's wife died. As did his Uncle. 

The _Hijra_ was the migration fo the Muslim community from Mecca to Medina. This, for Muslims, was the beginning of a new era of human history. This was done in hindsight. 

Mohammed was not just a prophet, he was a political leader of the city of Medina. There were a lot of people in Medina who were not Muslims. Perhaps the muslims took the Jews in the city as fellow monotheists. 

The Jews were, however, accused of being polytheists in disguise. It is possible that there were, also Jews in Medina who considered Ezra the son of, God, as chronicled by the Quaran. Mohammed ordered his followers, thus, to make war on the Jews. 

Perhaps because of the conflicts with the Jews, the Muslins decided to return to Mecca, and took the city by force. The took the Khaba and purged it of all gods but Allah, making it a religious requirement for all  Muslims to make a pilgrimage there. 

The Arabs would go to conquer large swaths of land, from Spain to Afghanistan. 

### The Quran

It is not in chronological order, and it's really meant to be read alongside the history of Mohammad and his followers. You need some sort of authoritative verision of the life of Mohammad and his followers. 

There is also the question of continuity. Are the revelations of the Quran binding for all muslims in the future? Or were they only suit to recent muslims? Is the ban universal, or for the inhabitants of Medina? There were many issues that were hotly debated within the muslin world.

In many cases, readers had to adjudicate many different pronounciations of the words in the text giving them a lot of different meanings.
