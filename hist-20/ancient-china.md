# Ancient China

There are three great teachings that have shaped Chinese religion — Confucaianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. A 20th century allegory outlines the three as the sun, the moon, and the five planets, outlining that they are all different but all contribute to the natural order.

During the era of the warring states of China, there was great skepticism regarding religion and suspicion that it was being used to manipulate the Chinese people.

## Confucius/Kongfuzi

He was a teacher who made the restoration of ancient ritual the main ideas of his program, as well as the restoration of human virtue. 

There was no such thing, really, as confucianism after the death of Confucius. Most ancient sages, such as socrates, were teachers, and not writers, so he did not actually write anything.

Because the teachings of Confucius were heavily edited and interpreted by his students who had written then down 100s of years later, it is hard to know what he really thought.

Confucianism and Daoism did not act like religions like Buddhism did. 

### The Western Zhao Dynasty

Historians describe what they call a ritual revolution — there was a great increase in ritual artifacts in both number and size, indicating that they were being conducted to impress a large human audience — participation and obedience through ritual.

In 771 BCE, the Western Zhao dynasty fell, and the King's sone started a new Eastern Zhao dynasty. However, it wasn't really a rule at all, there were just a ton of warring states, battling for supremacy.

Following the warring states period, there were around seven large states. In these conditions, the religious order fell and there were many scholars writing about suspicion against the gods.

### The "Writings" of Confucius

Confucius never wrote anything — he was a teacher, not a writer, Most of the record we have of what he said is due to, centuries later, pupils of Confucian thought wrote his teachings down. Those teachings, of course, were wrapped in interpretation by the students.

Confucian thought was mainly a curriculum — highly associated with classicism. It was not a religion, and the writings were no "holy writing." The goal was to understand the nature of a good society. 

### Confucianism

Confucius had a reverence for the past, and appreciated the classics. He established that the past should always be the guideline for how to live in the future. 

He states that following is fundamentally orderly and there would be stability insofar as the past provides structure. The act of following brings virtue.

The core of Confucian thought was to live life as if it was a ritual — by strict rules that gave order. The purpose of daily ritual was to create virtue within the performer — this creates order in society.

It is hard to draw the line between Confucian ritual and thought could be classified between religion and philosophy. In the end, this question is presentist.

### Han Dynasty

During the Han Dynasty, there was an establishment of an Imperian Academy, in order to train students in the classics. At this point, reformer Dong Zhongshu spread the idea that Confucius himself was a son of heaven — an uncronwed king, whose teachings must be followed. This was not actually true — there were scholars later who wrote these things. The intgegration of the classics into the government would later allow confucianism to exist. 

Every literate person in China would study the classics and Confucian work. One poet stated even that Confucius was the bridge between heaven and earth. 

 This early Confucianism was a foundation for maintaining order and filial piety within the empire. It essentially becomes the main philosophy of the government.

## Daoism

The Laozi, written supposedly by a man who is documented mostly in legend named Laozi, is a collection of quotes. Laozi would rise to sagehood in the same manner that Confucius did. There were people who were thinking about how self-conservation and knowledge could establish the government.

The word Dao means a way or a path — in particular, the path of nature, rather than resisting that path. Instead of following human-established order, similar to Confucianism, Daoism stated that humans should follow the order of nature.  

This is basically the anti-Confucian thought.

The Daodejing \(the Laozi text\)'s main idea was to behave in a natural way. Non-action is virtue. Become passive and open, follow the eternal Dao and do not choose a path for oneself. The book is, of course, cryptic and unclear. It's a really loose frame on which to hang ideas rather than a coherent book. 

There was an idea of too much order vs. not enough. Daoism is a mode of critique of too much government. 

Early Daoism was religious, but it did not truly become religion until later on. Overall, it was an interjection into Chinese politics under the pretext of a religious influence.

### How it became to be one of the three teachings

Many militaristic and popular movements were associating themselves with the Dao. One of them was called, "The Way of the Celestial Masters."  Their practices aimed at achieving long life and/or immortality, insofar as immortality is concerned with being reabsorbed by the Dao. 

In the second century, there were several rebellions in china which took the Way of the Celestial Masters. The rebels managed to conquer the small region of Hanzhong, and through negotiations with the Han government, they achieved independence. This would become a theocratic state, and launched an experiment. There was a rice tax, which was redistributed to the poor and to travelers. By redistributing wealth they achieved a mass following. 

The core doctrine of the Celestial Masters' Daoism was that there was predestination through Celestial records. There's no sacrifices involved in petitioning the gods in Daoism, and therefore there was scrutiny against Confucianism. 

Laozi was divinized, established as the Dao himself who kept returning to earth. 

The arrival of Buddhism reformed Daoism into a religion, because Buddhism taught China what a religion ought to be.
