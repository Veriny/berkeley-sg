# Prehistoric Religion

Humans have been studying religion from written texts, but religion has been in existence for far longer than writing has.

{% hint style="danger" %}
A large challenge associated with studying prehistoric religion is determining what kinds of objects were actually associated with symbolic thinking.

### Stone Tools

Well, for one example, stone tools are not indicative of any symbolic thinking, for they are fully utilitarian. However, stone tools soon became more symmetrical, made with rarer rocks, etc. This means that we know that their brains were gaining an appreciation for art and aesthetics. 

### Cannibalism

Prehistoric humans have been practicing cannibalism, but evidence from around 450k years ago implies that there was ritual cannibalism \(evidence being some bones were missing — some parts were eaten over others because perhaps the meaning of different body parts were different\).

### Early Art

The earliest known engraving is a zigzag engraving, the first example of art. There is more limited archaeological evidence of art — a rock that was shaped as a human, which was modified by early Moroccans. 

The first known evidence of art made by _Homo Sapiens_ was a series of engravings made in Blombos Cave. Not particularly strong evidence for religion, but food for thought nonetheless.

### Burial of the Dead

There is some evidence for some burial of the dead — early species of hominid created a grave with around 32 bodies, buried with a perfectly unused stone axe. Perhaps this was a gift to the dead? Some kind of evidence of belief of life after death? Of course, this is not conclusive evidence. Perhaps the axe got there accidentally, and there are plenty of other reasons to throw bodies in a pit other than for spiritual ones.

There are a lot of potential examples of pre-modern humans creating burial sites, but we are not sure whether these are actual ritual burials or mass graves.

### The Creative Explosion

Around 40,000 BP, we see a large amount of figurative art that is clearly meant to be symbolic and/or perhaps religious. A great deal of the evidence for the creative explosion can be found in France and Spain, in the limestone caves that they hold.

The caves were somewhat evidence of semi-sedantary behavior, meaning that people were coming back to the same places every year.

Note it is entirely possible that there was much more art that was made on things that are not caves and therefore did not survive.

A lot of the images and paintings were of humans and animals. **Humans did not live in the caves,** but went down in order to draw in them, not live in them. There were also animal bones stuck in the cave walls and all — and there was an implication that somehow dead animals were being made to rehabilitate the cave.

Venus figures are some of the oldest figurines that were made by humans, — lots are around 25k, 40k years old. They are made of rock, ivory, some even ceramic. Perhaps they were fertility goddesses?

There were also the beginnings of anthropomorphized animals — creatures that do not exist in real life. This kind of thing has to be some kind of cultural background because it has to have had a large cultural background for how good the craft was. 

### An Increase in Ritual

There is a lot of evidence of ritual burial, such as pained bones, bodies holding the corpses of children, tools, etc. This was around the period that the neanderthal became extinct because humans won the competition. 

## Why Did Religion Originate?

One idea states that because of the development of cognitive capacities, religion was simply developed as a byproduct. 

There is another idea that religion was a byproduct of humans achieving altered states of consciousness. This somewhat explains the cave paintings being "animations."

Another idea states that perhaps religion is advantageous to societies because there is some social benefit — for example, religion makes individuals work the for community. Another is taboo — danger that is placed restriction upon by religions. One example is incest. 

Religion helps with fixed settlements, as religious beliefs allow for rationing and saving, allowing a settlement to survive in one area for longer.
