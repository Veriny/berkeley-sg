# What is the History of Religion?

From specifics to generalities, there have been many odd similarities between different religions, whether it is using incense, choosing standing rocks for worship, or more importantly, having the standard structure of a higher being, a scripture, and an institution.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are structural similarities across religion across time and space. Religion is recursive.

There have been many theories as to why religions are so similar across human cultures.

* One religion is true and the rest are derivations from the original revelations.
  * This view was prominent among the Christian community for a long time. This is the idea that the Isrealites and the Christians had the "most complete" version of religion.
* Knowledge of religion is natural, and it is part of the human consciousness. 
  * This is the same idea as the first idea, but there is no assumption here that one religion is correct. It is a common belief among modern worshippers and it allows for better inter-faith dialogue.
* Humans keep inventing religion because religion fulfills some kind of social need. Without it, society cannot function.
  * This version first emerged in the 18th century and 20th century. It is a commonplace secular explanation as to why religion is so recursive. The theory, according to a sociologist named Ã‰mie Durkheim, humans tend to be selfish, but with religion, they work for the community, meaning that societies with religion are more productive and therefore, the societies with religion are more likely to survive.
* There is also a biological theory that religion is genetic.
  * The theory is that if religion is not present in inhuman animals or our common ancestors, perhaps there is a gene for religion. Leading geneticist Dean Hamer, in his book _The God Gene,_ theorized that a gene predisposed humans to religious activity.
* Geneological Explanation: religion is not actually recursive, and western scholars have invented the concept of religion and simply smushed cultural practices as religions. There is no religion, there are only cultural practices which, in a westernized view, are only _seen_ as religion.
  * A man named Talal Asad wrote a book in which he stated that separating religion as a conscious of belief, distinct from politics and law, is a uniquely Christian thing.As such, Christians looked upon those cultures where their "religion" was baked into their cultures and looked down upon them. 
  * Religion as a concept has its own history which is not the same in other places as it is in the West.

The History of Religion is not only the raw histories of what the content of the religions are, but the history of the idea of religion itself 
{% endhint %}

Through the lens of history, we will try to understand why there are so many similarities across religion, and what the significance of it is. We will approach the concept of a "history of religion" less as a topic and more of a methodology.

**Why is this important?** Well, religions love to tell their own religions. There are many religions, such as Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity, that have an affect on a lot of people. Therefore, when a religion declares its boundaries of morality and cultural authenticity, it therefore affects a lot of people.
