# The Investiture Controversy

The first great controversy in the Holy Roman Empire was the appointment of church leaders. This whole thing was called the Investiture Controversy. Through the middle ages, the investiture of local bishops was one of the major ways that secular leaders maintained their authority. The power to appoint bishops was a **major source of their power.** 

Powerful families would consolidate their power to make their constituents church leaders. Bishops themselves were princes of their empires who held large amounts of land. 

Pope Gregory VII wanted to end this, and restore the spiritual power. He stated that only the pope can appoint bishops. The Emperor declared that there should be a new pope. As such, the Pope excommunicated the Emperor, thus using religious power to depose him from his crown. The result was a rebellion against the Holy Roman empire. He had to back down because he lacked the military power to but the rebellion down. 

At one point, the king bullied the church into accepting the King's right hand man as the archbishop of canturbury, who literally not even a priest, and in the eyes of many, a sinner.

Weirdly, on the day of this establishment, he released all of his secular obligations, meaning that there was no longer any reason for him to be the archbishop because he was only meant to be a puppet.  

He and the king had many conflicts. Becket protected a priest who was accused of killing a knight, and he was locked up. Becket escaped and went to the pope, gaining the authority to excommunicate any bishop who followed the king. He also gained the power to put an interdict over England, meaning that all religious sacrements performed in England invalid. 

In the year 1170, Henry II said some violent words against the priest. Four knights heard this and murdered Thomas Beckett. As such, he was taken to be a martyr and a saint. He was immediately made Saint Thomas of Canterbury, and he was quickly canonized.
