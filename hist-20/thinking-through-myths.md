# Thinking Through Myths

The Ancient Greeks didn't know they had myths — they just thought they had stories. Mythology was invented as a construct by the west as a perjorative term — failing to create a credible account of the past or as a spiritual guideline. Myth was originally invented to describe things that "failed" to be religion.

Today, a myth either means a traditional folktale or a falsehood \(think Mythbusters\). 

> "A myth is a socially important narrative... told in such a way as to allow the entire social collective to share a sense of this importance" — Eric Caspo

Historically, myths formed a basis for religion. By studying ancient myths, we get a window into how they thought.

## Theories about the origins and purpose of myth

* Sigmund Freud — theorized that myths are the fulfillment of wishes. They are related to dreams, expressions of the unconscious. 
* Carl Jung — there is a collective unconscious, but we are separated physically and culturally. We can reconnect with the collective unconscious through the telling of myths. 
* Joseph Campbell — all myths represented a monomyth — a single structure of mythology that involves a hero which is a normal person who goes on an adventure, attains supernatural powers, does things, and returns to ordinary life. 
* Mircea Eliade — myths are repositories of truth in that they explain origins. Myth makes itself different from other forms of explanation by returning us to mythic times, erasing the separation between ourselves in the past. Myths are not a primitive version of science, rather, science is an impoverished version of myth. Modern myths include literature, film, etc. We need this in our lives and science has failed to provide it. 
* Claude Lévi-Strauss — structuralism, the reason myths are so similar is because they are written with the same components. Basic units of myth. What he found was that there were always binary opposition — nature vs nurture, wild vs tame, etc.  

## Case Study — Greek Mythology

A lot of Greek mythology focuses on theogeny — or the origin of the gods \(War between gods and titans\). Following, the creation of humanity \(Prometheus who creates man and is punished\). Thus comes the heroic age, which is what is made of many of the myths we are familiar with — Greek civilization + Trojan war, etc.  

A quirk of Greek mythology is that a lot of the myths have potential to breed other myths. These can be mixed with actual historical events \(such as the founding of Rome\). 

> "Myths are like fan-fictions on a massive scale" — Prof. Ethan Shagan

A lot of Greek mythology was assimilating other cultures \(for example, the myths of babylonia\) into their own myths. 

Back then, myths were largely oral — we know this because there are inclusion of elements of songs and stories that are memorized. It also contained epithets, which allowed the reciter to keep the meter going even if the thing they are telling are not exactly the same as before. 

Rhapsodists often recited myths in order to give meaning to worshipping the gods. Ancient Greece featured many ritual events, such as religious festivals and state funerals. 

Of course, myths were also presented as dramas — plays. As an example, thousands of Athenians attended the plays of the the Amphitheater. 

Myths were also represented in art — statues, illustrations, etc. Generally speaking, in Greek temples, the interiors were private places where priestesses /priests cared for gods and goddesses, who took the form of statues. 

## Understanding the Past Through Mythology

We can make inferences about the way the people of the past through creation/origin stories. 

There is a Greek myth that was written by a soldier 22 years after the liberation of Athens — as a celebration of the gods, weaving together a series of myths that were well known to his audience already. 

In the myth, Agamemmnon incurs the wrath of Artemis, who creates illness among his soldiers and destroys the winds in order to prevent him from fighting Troy. In order to appease the wrath he sacrifices his daughter. He is killed in revenge, whose killer is killed in revenge by Orestes. Athena, during Orestes' trial, declares that there must be law rather than more violence. The whole play is a charter myth for legitimate law, saying that the state should have a monopoly in justice, not citizens who enact violent revenge.  

The myth was given legitimacy in the theater competition, and the myth gives legitimacy to the Athenian government. 

Myths were also used to justify gendered society. For example, Pandora was not given to man as a gift, but as a punishment. All of the miseries of the world come from Pandora's pithos — a sexual innuendo. From the man's point of view, the vagina seems like a gift but in reality it is a terrible curse.

Interpretation is important — choosing whether to read a myth from a gendered point of view is difficult.

There is also mythology that is up for interpretation. FOr example, Nereus and Doris's myth could be read as feminine violence \(killing a child in revenge for rape\) but it could alos be a suggestion for female solidarity against rape, as well as sisterhood.

There is also the myth of Hades and Persephone — a story about rape and forced marraige, which a lot of Greek women went through
