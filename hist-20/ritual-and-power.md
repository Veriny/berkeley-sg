# Ritual and Power

Premodern religions generally focused on ritual, not belief — what you did and how you acted. Ritual is the context where religion intersects with power. This is in that political entities have little power over what you believe, but they do have power over what you do. 

**Ritual is where you demonstrate your contribution to the collective.**

At the most basic level, a ritual is a repetitive, scripted, and collective sequence of activities.

Victor Turner and Mary Douglas, leading anthropologists, rituals rope individuals into the collective by challenging the normal order. 

Others, Clifford Geertz and Talal Azad, state that ritual actively makes the social order and creates meaning out of disorder. In essence, the opposite of Turner and Douglas.

## Sacrifice

Sacrifice is the fundamental ritual of religion. Sacrifice is almost entirely tied to religion. The gist of sacrifice is, that an object is made sacred and then given up. It is an exchange of gifts with the gods — as well as a creator of relationships between humans and the divine.

## Ritual in Ancient China

Early sacrifices in China often involved wine, ale, animals, and in the earlier periods, there was human sacrifice. Those things were offered to a wide variety of different powers, such as ancestors, spirits, and gods. 

Generally, only rulers were allowed to sacrifice things to the heavenly lord, whereas locals sacrificed to local spirits, as well as their ancestors.

There is already a structure of authority here — for example, locals would not be allowed to make human sacrifices because, of course, that would just be murder. 

In 1899, an academic was prescribed dragon bones to heal an illness. Those dragon bones turned out to be ancient bones with scriptures. This discovery launched an archaeological hunt. 

The origin of the bones were tracked down, and at the site there were thousands of oracle bones — as well as evidence of an early Chinese dynasty. The bones thenselves were mostly ox bones and turtle shells with scripture on them. They were used in divination performed by the Shang dynasty royal family. 

Many of the divinations asked the divine about sacrifices — what to sacrifices, who to sacrifice to, etc. This may seen Quid Pro Quo in nature, but there was also a sense that the ancestors and lords were unruly — and that they needed to be placated with sacrifices implying that the relationship between the sacrificer and the ancestors was important. As such, it's more like an act of worship.
