# Ritual and Power

Premodern religions generally focused on ritual, not belief â€” what you did and how you acted. Ritual is the context where religion intersects with power. This is in that political entities have little power over what you believe, but they do have power over what you do. 

**Ritual is where you demonstrate your contribution to the collective.**

Victor Turner and Mary Douglas, leading anthropologists, rituals rope individuals into the collective by challenging the normal order. 

Others, Clifford Geertz and Talal Azad, state that ritual actively makes the social order and creates meaning out of disorder. In essence, the opposite of Turner and Douglas.
