# Ritual and Power

Premodern religions generally focused on ritual, not belief — what you did and how you acted. Ritual is the context where religion intersects with power. This is in that political entities have little power over what you believe, but they do have power over what you do. 

**Ritual is where you demonstrate your contribution to the collective.**

At the most basic level, a ritual is a repetitive, scripted, and collective sequence of activities.

Victor Turner and Mary Douglas, leading anthropologists, rituals rope individuals into the collective by challenging the normal order. 

Others, Clifford Geertz and Talal Azad, state that ritual actively makes the social order and creates meaning out of disorder. In essence, the opposite of Turner and Douglas.

## Sacrifice

Sacrifice is the fundamental ritual of religion. Sacrifice is almost entirely tied to religion. The gist of sacrifice is, that an object is made sacred and then given up. It is an exchange of gifts with the gods — as well as a creator of relationships between humans and the divine.

## Ritual in Ancient China

Early sacrifices in China often involved wine, ale, animals, and in the earlier periods, there was human sacrifice. Those things were offered to a wide variety of different powers, such as ancestors, spirits, and gods. 

Generally, only rulers were allowed to sacrifice things to the heavenly lord, whereas locals sacrificed to local spirits, as well as their ancestors.

There is already a structure of authority here — for example, locals would not be allowed to make human sacrifices because, of course, that would just be murder. 

In 1899, an academic was prescribed dragon bones to heal an illness. Those dragon bones turned out to be ancient bones with scriptures. This discovery launched an archaeological hunt. 

The origin of the bones were tracked down, and at the site there were thousands of oracle bones — as well as evidence of an early Chinese dynasty. The bones thenselves were mostly ox bones and turtle shells with scripture on them. They were used in divination performed by the Shang dynasty royal family. 

Many of the divinations asked the divine about sacrifices — what to sacrifices, who to sacrifice to, etc. This may seen Quid Pro Quo in nature, but there was also a sense that the ancestors and lords were unruly — and that they needed to be placated with sacrifices implying that the relationship between the sacrificer and the ancestors was important. As such, it's more like an act of worship.  

By claiming relationships between the sacrificer and the divine, the sacrificers are legitimized. When the king dies, there were human sacrifices — the servants of the crown killed to serve the king.

Ritual is a way of participating with the divine — it is not magic.

Both commoners and the elites took part in ritual — meaning that sometimes, ritual became contests for power. 

## Shrines and Temples

For larger scale rituals, places associated more "close" to the gods, such as temples, were created to separate ritual from the real world for elites. Such examples include the Parthenon in Athens, which was seen as the literal home of Athena. 

Shrines, on the other hand, were made for smaller sacrifices, and were located sometimes in private homes. 

Priests and the institutions who run rituals have immense power because there is the sense the the state depends on them.

### Rome

Priests were chosen and paid a stipend for life. The "College of Pontiffs" was the collective body of the high priests of the Roman state, consisting of the _pontifex maximus,_ or the high priest, and other  _pontifeces_. The _flamines_ were fifteen priests, head priests of certain gods. The goal of the pontiffs was to keep _pax deorum_, or the peace of the gods. 

Later on, a new law allowed any roman citizen to become a pontifex. At one point, even a plebeian was made a _pontifex maximus_. As such, the lower class was given the power to challenge the establishment. 

Later on, Roman citizens were allowed some power in voting for the _pontifex._ 

After an emperor's death, the Roman Senate could actually deify the deceased emperor.  

## Gender

Greece had both gods and goddesses — because women existed, they had to represented in the divine. Gods had male priests, and goddesses had female priests. There was simply a god for everyone — poseidon for sailors, ares for warriors, etc. 

Greek male leaders were unable to challenge the priestesses — as they were essential to religions ritual. Those same preiestesses also had extraordinary power. Of course, this means that we know much more about Greek women than women of many other civilizations. 

### The Cult of Pudicitia

This was the god of sexual morality and modesty. People were concerned with rampant sexual debauchery, so there was a cult around this goddess. She was supposed to grant you sexual control — so you could be a virtuous person. There is evidence that this cult was created in response to a conflict in gender relations. Following a scandal where 20 patrician men were poisoned by their wives, 200 more were accused of attempting to poison their wives. 

The shrines were only open married women who only have married once. There was a sense that sex with more than one man was ritually impure.
