# Imaging

Imaging in general is done by taking an energy source, a subject, and an energy detector. This way, you can fire the energy source through the subject and see how much at what places of the energy was absorbed by the energy detector. 

One example of an energy detector, of course, is a camera. 

In terms of a single pixel camera, you can recover a larger image using linear combinations of the pixels. For more information on linear combinations, please see notes on linear algebra.
