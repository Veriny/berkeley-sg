# Node Voltage Analysis

In the context of this class, **Node Voltage Analysis** is looking at portions of circuits in terms of their voltage in order to make sense of the circuits. 

A node is an area of a circuit where all the voltage is the same. It's typically, however, just labeled as a point an a wire, but it's important to keep in mind that the node accounts for the entire area.

The point of this is so that you can write element voltages and currents in terms of the node voltages, making it easier to determine what those unknowns are.
