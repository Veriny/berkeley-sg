# Introduction to Circuit Analysis

There are a few electrical quantities that we want to consider in this class

* Voltage — Measured in volts
* Current — Measured in amperes
* Resistance — Measured in ohms

An important equation for circuit analysis is **Ohm's Law.**

$$
V= IR
$$

Note the "Positive Sign Convention," which states that current gos in to the positive sign of the voltage and out of the negative side. 

### Kirchoff's Laws

The **sum** of all currents entering a node must equal the sum of all currents exiting the node. The **loop rule** states that the sum of the voltages across the elements of a connected loop must be zero.
